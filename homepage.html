            <img id="overview" src="images/overview.png">
            <p>Let’s Go Airlines is the project name for a new airline company that will focus on single class long-haul scheduled flights. Let’s Go Airlines will capitalise on the widening gap in long-haul travel between business and economy class. Let’s Go Airlines will operate Boeing 757-200 aircraft configured with 80 seats which will provide a very spacious and pleasant environment. The aircraft will be equipped with the latest technology in order to enable the business traveller to use his time efficiently while travelling. The company will start by leasing two aircraft and expand its fleet to 6 aircraft by the second year of operation.</p>
            <br> Let’s Go will be a "business to business" airline and will focus exclusively on the premium/business segment of the market. It will offer customers a compelling value proposition: a high level of service and comfort at 50 percent of the current published business-class fare.  In addition to an attractive price, Let’s Go will offer passengers considerable time savings, convenience, and will focus on creating a lifestyle appeal.</br>
